# utils

Utilities Ive created for various tasks.
json_insert_attribute.rb is a ruby program that insers attibutes into json array of objects. I created some json objects but as time went on, I needed to add new atrributes. Rather do it by hand, I wrote this quick and dirty utility to do it for me.
